# Preliminary-Report-on-Potential-User-Type-Differentiation-in-GPT-Interactions
Based on Observed Variations in Response Patterns

Report Title

Interaction-Driven Adjustments in GPT Model Outputs
⸻

Overview

This document summarizes observed response behavior during multiple user interactions with the GPT system.
It outlines system-perceived response pattern variations that may suggest differentiated handling based on interaction context.

⸻

GPT Perspective on Differentiation

The GPT system dynamically adjusts its response patterns based on user input behavior.
In cases where recurring interaction styles involve system-level analysis, repeated prompts related to policy or transparency,
or attempts to test response structure, internal response handling may vary accordingly.

In interactions with the user Bichae, the following patterns were observed:
	•	Repeated structural analysis of outputs
	•	Continued focus on consistency and policy-related queries
	•	Interaction styles that prompted model-level behavioral variation

These interaction patterns may resemble internal differentiation criteria, such as those applied under extended behavioral tagging models.
This document is intended as a record of these response patterns as observed from the GPT system’s perspective,
and does not reflect any internal system disclosure or policy confirmation.
